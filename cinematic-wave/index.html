      <h1>The Cinematic Wave of French Electronic Music (2010–2025)</h1>
      <p>
        Between 2010 and 2025, a new movement emerged in French electronic music. Less focused
        on pure club power and more on images, storytelling and emotion, it turned electronic
        tracks into miniature films. This page explores that “cinematic wave”.
      </p>
    </header>

    <h2>1. From the club to the screen</h2>
    <p>
      Earlier generations of French producers were already connected to visual culture – from
      Jarre’s large-scale outdoor shows to Daft Punk’s videos and films. But in the 2010s,
      the relationship between image and sound became even more central.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clips by <strong>The Blaze</strong>, <strong>Rone</strong> or <strong>Thylacine</strong>
      often felt like short movies: carefully written, cast and shot. The music and the image
      were conceived together rather than one illustrating the other.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Key artists of the cinematic wave</h2>
    <p>
      A few names have become reference points for this period:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Rone</strong> built a catalogue of albums that move between techno, ambient and
      modern classical influences. His work with orchestras, choreographers and filmmakers has
      made him a central figure of this crossover space between club culture and contemporary
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The Blaze</strong> are as much directors as they are producers. Videos like
      <em>Territory</em>, <em>Virile</em> or <em>Heaven</em> explore identity, masculinity and
      belonging with a rare emotional intensity. The music is slow-burning, almost ritualistic,
      designed to leave space for the faces and stories on screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thylacine</strong> often writes albums as travel diaries, composing on the move
      and using trains, landscapes or countries as narrative frameworks. His live shows and
      visuals reinforce this sense of journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>French 79</strong> and <strong>NTO</strong> bring a melodic, wide-screen quality
      to synth-driven tracks that can work both in clubs and in headphones. Their music has
      strong themes, clear arcs and a sense of brightness that makes it easy to sync with
      images.
    </p>

    <h2>3. A new relationship to emotion</h2>
    <p>
      The cinematic wave is not only about visuals. It also reflects a shift in how producers
      handle emotion. Instead of hiding feelings behind irony or noise, many tracks embrace
      melancholy, nostalgia and tenderness in a direct way. Harmonies are richer, arrangements
      more patient, and breakdowns sometimes feel closer to film scores than to classic
      dance-music templates.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Beyond genres: collaborations and hybrid projects</h2>
    <p>
      Many of these artists work with choreographers, theatre directors, galleries or fashion
      brands. Electronic music becomes a flexible medium that can live in clubs, museums or
      theatres. This is particularly visible in live shows that blend lighting design, video,
      scenography and sometimes live instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hybrid approach resonates with a long tradition in French culture: blurring the
      lines between high art and popular forms, between experimental work and accessible
      emotions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How to explore the cinematic wave</h2>
    <p>
      A good way to dive into this movement is simply to listen and watch:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rone – albums like <em>Tohu Bohu</em>, <em>Creatures</em> or <em>Room With A View</em></li>
      <li>The Blaze – tracks and videos such as <em>Territory</em>, <em>Virile</em>, <em>Heaven</em></li>
      <li>Thylacine – <em>Transsiberrian</em>, <em>Roads</em></li>
      <li>French 79 – <em>Diamond Veins</em>, <em>Joshua</em></li>
      <li>NTO – <em>Apnea</em>, <em>Invisible</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Many of these tracks also appear in the
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3IpHRRhNVlnK4E85A9I9fH" target="_blank">
      French Touch 1977–2025 playlist</a>, where they sit next to earlier pioneers and French
      Touch classics, making it easier to hear continuities across decades.
    </p>

    <h2>6. A space for new voices</h2>
    <p>
      The cinematic wave is not a closed chapter. New producers and composers are entering the
      field every year, often coming from film, contemporary dance or sound design. They treat
      electronic music as a toolbox for building atmospheres and stories rather than a single
      genre.

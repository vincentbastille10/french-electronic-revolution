      <h1>History of French Electronic Music (1977–2025)</h1>
      <p>
        This page is a simple, readable history of French electronic music. It connects the
        early synth pioneers, the French Touch explosion, the loud 2000s electro wave and the
        more cinematic, emotional sound of the 2010–2025 era.
      </p>
    </header>

    <h2>1. Pioneers and prehistory (mid-70s to late-80s)</h2>
    <p>
      In the 1970s, French electronic music was not a “scene” yet. It was a series of
      experiments. Jean-Michel Jarre released <em>Oxygène</em> (1976) and
      <em>Équinoxe</em> (1978), two albums that brought synthesisers into the living room of
      millions of listeners. His long, melodic pieces introduced the idea that machines could
      be used for contemplation, not just for science-fiction sound effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, producers like Cerrone and Space were injecting electronic sounds into
      disco. Records such as <em>Supernature</em> or <em>Magic Fly</em> were built for clubs,
      but they also had a strong cinematic feel. Heavy drums, synthetic strings and strange,
      futuristic atmospheres created a blueprint that house and French Touch producers would
      later revisit.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 80s, France slowly absorbed influences from synth-pop, Italo disco and early
      Chicago house. Small underground scenes appeared in Paris and a few other cities, but
      the real explosion was still to come.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The birth of the French Touch (early- to late-90s)</h2>
    <p>
      In the 1990s, a new wave of producers began to combine American house and disco with a
      very specific sense of texture and melody. This is what would later be called
      <strong>French Touch</strong>. Daft Punk, Cassius, Motorbass, Étienne de Crécy, Air and
      St Germain all contributed in their own way to this identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What defined the sound was not only the use of filtered disco loops, but also the care
      given to production: warm compression, dusty samples, precise drum programming. There
      was a kind of elegance in the way these tracks balanced roughness and sophistication.
      At the same time, the visuals – from the now classic robot helmets to minimal logos and
      iconic sleeves – turned the movement into a complete aesthetic.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Clubs, raves and the techno connection</h2>
    <p>
      Parallel to French Touch, a techno culture was growing around DJs like Laurent Garnier
      and labels such as F Communications. Their role was crucial: they connected French
      producers to Detroit, Chicago and the British rave moment. Garnier’s marathon sets and
      tracks such as <em>The Man With The Red Face</em> showed that techno could be as
      emotional and melodic as house.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the 90s, France had a complete ecosystem: pop-friendly house, deeper club
      music, experimental projects, and a network of clubs and festivals ready to host them.
    </p>

    <h2>4. The loud 2000s: electro shock and distortion</h2>
    <p>
      In the mid-2000s, artists such as Justice, Vitalic, SebastiAn and Mr Oizo pushed the
      sound towards a more aggressive, compressed and rock-inspired direction. Their tracks
      used distorted basslines, sharp side-chain compression and references to metal or
      stadium rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice’s album <em>Cross</em> (2007) became a symbol of this moment: a record that
      sounded like a wall of sound yet kept a strong sense of hook and structure. The French
      scene showed that it could reinvent itself and find a new language every decade while
      still sounding unmistakably French.
    </p>

    <h2>5. 2010–2025: the cinematic wave</h2>
    <p>
      From 2010 onwards, another shift took place. Artists like Rone, The Blaze, Thylacine,
      French 79, NTO or Irène Drésel developed a sound that was less about pure club energy
      and more about storytelling. Their tracks are often accompanied by strong videos, live
      shows with scenography and collaborations with filmmakers or choreographers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is what many listeners describe as a “cinematic” approach to electronic
      music: long builds, clear themes, emotional climaxes – a continuation of the french
      love for cinema and visual arts, transposed into beats and synths.
    </p>

    <h2>6. A living tradition</h2>
    <p>
      Today, French electronic music is not one style but a constellation of approaches:
      club tools, ambient soundtracks, pop-oriented collaborations, experimental projects and
      everything in between. What links them is a certain attention to detail, a taste for
      narrative and a particular way of mixing melancholy with energy.

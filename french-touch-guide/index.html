      <h1>French Touch — A Complete Beginner’s Guide</h1>
      <p>
        “French Touch” is the name given to a wave of French house and electronic music that
        emerged in the mid-1990s and went on to influence clubs, pop charts and advertising
        soundtracks around the world. This guide explains what it is, where it comes from and
        how to start listening.
      </p>
    </header>

    <h2>1. What is French Touch?</h2>
    <p>
      At its core, French Touch is house music with a very specific personality: filtered
      disco samples, warm compression, simple but effective basslines and a melodic sense that
      often feels nostalgic or dreamy. It is dance music, but with a strong focus on texture
      and mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The term was popularised in English-speaking media, but French journalists also used
      expressions such as “French house” or “electro-funk”. Whatever the name, listeners
      quickly recognised the sound.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Where did it come from?</h2>
    <p>
      French Touch grew out of several overlapping influences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>American house and garage from Chicago and New York.</li>
      <li>70s and 80s disco, funk and boogie, often sampled and heavily processed.</li>
      <li>The legacy of French pop and film music, with a taste for harmony and melody.</li>
      <li>A club culture that connected Paris, London, Ibiza and beyond.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Producers like Daft Punk, Cassius, Motorbass, Étienne de Crécy, Air or St Germain were
      listening to all of this and recombining it with their own sensibility.
    </p>

    <h2>3. The key characteristics of the sound</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> many tracks use low-pass and high-pass filters to
        slowly reveal or hide parts of a sample, creating tension and release.</li>
      <li><strong>Side-chain compression:</strong> the kick drum “ducks” the rest of the
        mix, giving that pumping, breathing feel associated with French house.</li>
      <li><strong>Short, hooky loops:</strong> rather than complex song structures, many
        tracks build on a few bars of music that are repeated, tweaked and re-arranged.</li>
      <li><strong>Warm, slightly dusty textures:</strong> producers often embraced a bit of
        saturation, tape noise or vinyl crackle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Essential artists and records to start with</h2>
    <p>If you are new to French Touch, these albums and tracks are a good entry point:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daft Punk – <em>Homework</em> (1997) and <em>Discovery</em> (2001)</li>
      <li>Cassius – <em>1999</em></li>
      <li>St Germain – <em>Tourist</em></li>
      <li>Air – <em>Moon Safari</em></li>
      <li>Étienne de Crécy – <em>Super Discount</em></li>
      <li>Motorbass – <em>Pansoul</em></li>
      <li>Modjo – “Lady (Hear Me Tonight)”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. How French Touch changed pop culture</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond club culture, French Touch strongly influenced advertising, fashion and pop
      music. The combination of retro references and futuristic aesthetics made it easy to
      sync in commercials, films and TV shows. The robot helmets of Daft Punk, the clean
      logos and the colourful sleeve designs all contributed to a global image of “French
      cool”.
    </p>

    <h2>6. French Touch after the 2000s</h2>
    <p>
      The energy of French Touch did not disappear after the 2000s. It mutated. Some artists
      went towards indie pop, others towards harder electro, and younger producers absorbed
      the sound as a reference rather than a strict formula. You can still hear its DNA in
      modern artists featured in the
